# **NOTE TO REVIEWER**

The program takes a long time to run. Please close the matplotlib img to proceed with further execution of the code.

The program may not give waypoints to the simulator, in that case try running the program from a normal terminal instead of a integrated IDE terminal (like the one VS code has).
